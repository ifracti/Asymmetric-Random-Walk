# Asymmetric-Random-Walk
I investigate random walks under asymmetric conditions, and prove that even for transient asymmetric walks there exists points which have a much higher probability of being visited than other points. I use the results to investigate and predict a Brownian Motion of a charged particle under a strong external electric field.
